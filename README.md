X-ray Image Classification for COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia and Normal
This project focuses on the automatic classification of chest X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19, viral pneumonia, or normal. Utilizing a deep learning # # model, it processes medical images to identify and distinguish between these conditions. The goal is to provide a fast, reliable, and scalable solution for aiding in the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. The model was trained on a dataset of labeled X-ray images, achieving promising accuracy in differentiating between the three  categories, which can be valuable in medical settings to support decision-making and alleviate diagnostic workloads.
